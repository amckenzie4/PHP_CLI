A command line argument parser for PHP

This project was inspired by an attempt to tweak a PHP script to work on the command line, instead of through a 
web site.  It was a truly simple script, and it should have been easy, but dealing with command line arguments
turned out to be less simple than I wanted.  Obviously, the correct solution was to start a new programming project 
to resolve the problem.

This is based on the behaviour of the command line parser in Perl, with a few modifications.  The demo-argHandler.php file is about all the real documentation there is, and is fairly thorough.
